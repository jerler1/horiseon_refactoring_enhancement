# **Horiseon Code Refactor**

## **Goal**

The code was built in a non-accessable way, and the main goal was to access the code and make it more accessable.  Accessable websites get better access to search engines and it makes the website more accessible to more potential customers. To do this HTML tags were replaced with more approiate semantic tags and alt tags were created for all images.

While the code was being modified the code was being cleaned up.  The redudant class tags were consolidated and more approriate tags were assigned for all class tags involved.  

[The deployed website](https://jerler1.github.io/horiseon_refactoring_enhancement/) has a more robust accessbility suite now, and is more likely to be accessed via search engines due to the accessibility improvements.
